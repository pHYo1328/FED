                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I first come to Singapore Polytechnic, all the staffs and seniors are
                            warmly
                            welcome and eager to help us. For our SoC class, brother Isaiah, Wei Yu and Wei Ji Kwok are
                            guidliners.
                            They helped us to register our calculators,introduced to our personal lecturer and made us
                            to play
                            ice-breaking games to make more
                            friendly between classmates. They also show us foodcourts and secretly tell us which
                            foodcourt is
                            the
                            best. We are all introduced by all clubs in SoC and persuade to join them.The whole
                            experience is
                            joyful
                            and interesting.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; First week in Singapore Polytechnic give me kinda mixing feeling of
                            exciting
                            and
                            frightening. I met with lots of friends, have my own study group and project groups. At
                            first, I
                            was
                            afraid of teachers but teachers way of communicating us make me feel ease. Now I am enjoying
                            my
                            course and trying to push my limits and go out of comfort zone.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Another new experience in Singapore polytechnic is Sport For Life(SFL). In my
                        country, there is no
                        complementary sport modeule for every student. We need to configure ourself by joining student
                        sport
                        clubs or external sport course. In SP, they make complementary sport modules and everyone need
                        to join.
                        The schedule have both for physical sport activities and mental wellness class for students. I
                        think SP
                        aim to develop not only literacy smart students but also physically and mentally fit
                        students. There are six types of modules: badminton, tennis, street soccer, strength and
                        conditioning,
                        yoga and chokeball. I got tennis modeule. At first, I think we play just for fun but SP provide
                        us
                        professional couch to teach us.

                            In Singapore Polytechnic, there are 6 foodcourts and serve cuisines from all over the world.
                            They
                            have cuisines from western, chinese, korean, japanese and so on and prices are maiximum $5.5
                            as they
                            made the foods are affordable for students. I usually go to foodcourt 4 and korean or
                            western food
                            as tastes are very good and prices are cheap.

                            Applications development with three specialist tracks:
